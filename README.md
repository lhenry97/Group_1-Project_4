The purpose for this project is to assist with breast cancer survial through early intervention by using machine learning to predict a diagnosis on whether the identified cancer is Benign or Malignant. The features that will be used to assist in determining the diagnosis are physical characteristics of the cancer including: mean radius, mean texture, mean perimeter, mean area, mean smoothness, mean compactness, mean concavity and mean concave points. The dataset identifed for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set.
